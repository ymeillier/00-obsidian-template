This repository contains the .obsidian config directory used as our reference obsidian configurations when creating a new permanentt or temporary vault with the `obsidian` or `obsidian_tmp` commands.

See [https://github.com/ymeillier/043-obsidian-setup/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/ymeillier/043-obsidian-setup/blob/main/README.md) for our Obsidian workflow.

[Template.md](./Template.md) covers configurations, plugins, and customization configured on our template vault.
